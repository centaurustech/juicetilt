## Background

I am taking Lockitron's [Selfstarter](http://selfstarter.us) project and adapting it to include users, mailers, and multiple campaigns as the main features. This is a practice application for me to learn and try things out in preparation for a full fledge kickstarter clone build. 

### Tests

I am very new to Rails and testing has slowed down my progress (bad, I know). Make it work, break it, then I'll test it. :)
